# Loan Prediction
Loans are the core business of banks. The main profit comes directly from 
the loan’s interest. The loan companies grant a loan after an intensive 
process of verification and validation. However, they still don’t have 
assurance if the applicant is able to repay the loan with no difficulties.

### The goal of the project is to:

• Predict if the user can take loan or not from the given features.
#### Predictive Modules :
• ✅ Logistic Regression.

• ✅ ID3(Decision Tree).

• ✅ SVM (Support vector machine).

• ✅ Random forest.

• ✅ Navie Bayes.

• ✅ K-Nearest Neighbour.
